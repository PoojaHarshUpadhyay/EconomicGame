# Simulation introduction 

“This simulation will take the form of an economic game. 
Your objective in this game is to accumulate the maximum amount of net income at the end of each round. 
There are four rounds in this game, each containing ten “years”. 
Every year you will receive a certain amount of income. 
It is then up to you to report your income and pay income tax on the income you reported. 
Once you confirm your reported income the game will automatically calculate your income tax owed and will subtract this from your gross income.
From time to time audits will be conducted, and if you are found underreporting your income you will be subject to a large tax on the unreported income plus the tax on your gross income. 
In this way, the more you underreport, the higher the fine. 

At the beginning of each round you will be presented with a letter from the government reminding you to pay your taxes. 
Please read this document carefully as it contains information about that round’s respective tax rate and fine for underreported income. 
Keep this information in mind while playing the game. 
Finally, at a date in the near future, the user with the highest net income after all four rounds will receive a money prize in addition to the compensation given following the completion of the game.

Good luck!”
